# NeuralNexus: Decentralized AI Training Marketplace

A privacy-first decentralized marketplace for AI model training built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security and zero-knowledge proofs to enable collaborative machine learning without exposing sensitive data.

## üß† Vision

NeuralNexus bridges the gap between data privacy and collaborative AI advancement. By enabling secure, privacy-preserved machine learning on distributed data, we're creating a ecosystem where:

- **Data providers** can monetize their data without sacrificing privacy
- **AI researchers** can access diverse, high-quality training data
- **Model developers** can create and license AI models with secure ownership rights
- **Computation providers** can contribute resources and earn rewards

All while leveraging the security and finality of Bitcoin through the Stacks blockchain.

## üîë Key Features

### Privacy-First Data Contribution
- Zero-knowledge proofs for data verification without exposure
- Multi-layered encryption system for contributed datasets
- Granular permission system for data usage constraints

### Decentralized Model Training
- Federated learning implementation with blockchain coordination
- Verifiable computation proof-of-work system
- Distributed training across multiple computation providers

### Smart Contract Powered Marketplace
- Automated compensation distribution to all contributors
- Transparent pricing mechanism for data and computation
- Reputation system for data quality and computation reliability

### Secure Model Ownership
- Bitcoin-secured model ownership registry
- Flexible licensing terms encoded in smart contracts
- Royalty distribution for derived models

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Clarity)
- **marketplace.clar**: Core marketplace functionality
- **model-registry.clar**: Model ownership and licensing
- **data-rights.clar**: Data rights and permissions
- **computation-verification.clar**: Proof-of-work verification
- **compensation.clar**: Payment distribution and royalties
- **zk-verification.clar**: Zero-knowledge proof verification

### Privacy Layer
- Homomorphic encryption for data operations
- Zero-knowledge proofs for data validity
- Secure multi-party computation for model training

### Storage Layer
- Encrypted distributed storage
- Content-addressed data referencing
- Metadata storage on Stacks

### Computation Layer
- Distributed training orchestration
- Model verification and validation
- Computation resource management

## üîÑ Workflow

1. **Data Contribution**
   - Provider encrypts and uploads data
   - Zero-knowledge proofs validate data quality metrics
   - Provider sets usage permissions and compensation requirements

2. **Model Development**
   - Developer creates training job with specific requirements
   - Smart contract matches compatible data providers
   - Computation providers execute training on encrypted data

3. **Result Verification**
   - Trained model results are verified by the network
   - Compensation is automatically distributed to all contributors
   - Model ownership is registered with licensing terms

4. **Model Licensing**
   - Models can be licensed for use by others
   - Licensing fees automatically distributed to contributors
   - Derivative works tracked with appropriate royalty distribution
